## How to set up your MongoDB
You can choose from various options - from your local DB to cloud one. Here is a short instruction of creating a free cloud cluster:
1. Create a free account on https://www.mongodb.com/cloud
2. Create a free cluster (select your preferred vendor and location - it's recommended to choose the one nearest your location)
3. On the site, add user with access to the database (under Security -> Database Access) and add configure Network Access - for test purposes, you could go into Network Access -> Add IP Address -> Allow Access from anywhere.

> The instructions above are just a proposition of creating a free cloud instance of MongoDB for testing purposes. If you are planning going to production, you have to check your preferred cloud vendor and modify access/network settings.
